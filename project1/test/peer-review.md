# Peer review: Phonebook<br>
- Code Structure/CMake:
	- /include/ and /src/ are self explanatory
	- CML includes entire /include/ directory
	- gtest fetched so manual install isn't needed
- Modularity/Readability:
	- Person and Phonebook have discrete namespaces
	- Person::display() is separate from PhoneBook::printContacts(), which is nice
	- Phonebook::searchByNumber returns a raw pointer, could be unsafe
	- Tests are split up by source file based on what they test
- Test Coverage:
	- Some edge cases not tested, new tests added in review
- Bugs/Gaps:
	- Phonebook::searchByName() is case sensitive
	- Phonebook::updateContact() doesn't prevent duplicating a phone number
	- main is very barebones, would be nice to a more comprehensive and/or interactive demo
- Test Output:
	- All tests pass except for new edge case tests
	- Test names are sufficiently self explanatory
- New tests:
	- IsDigits.EmptyNumber: The check for invalid phone numbers doesn't catch empty strings.
	- FixturePB.DupeContact: The check for duplicate numbers does properly function.
	- FixturePB.UpdateContactInvalidNumber: The check for invalid phone numbers isn't run for updating existing contacts.
	- FixturePB.DupeUpdateNumber: The check for duplicated phone numbers isn't run for updating existing contacts.
	- FixturePB.SearchCaseInsensitive: Searching for contacts is case-sensitive. This maybe undesired behavior.
- Possible improvements to code structure and modularity:
	- Validation of inputs could be handled with utility boolean functions instead of including logic in adding/modifying functions.
	- Could use exceptions instead of booleans for greater clarity.
	- Should refactor structs to be classes with data kept private.
