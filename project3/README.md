# Project 3 - Phonebook application

This is a continuation of Project 2. It keeps the same core functionality, but it is now refactored to implement core principles of Object Oriented Programming:
Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Composition.

This project also introduces the use of `unique_pointers` to ensure each contact that is added is unique
