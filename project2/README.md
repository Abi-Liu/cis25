# Project 2 - Phonebook application

This is a continuation of my phonebook project in project 1.

There are several new features added, including a REPL to make the user experience more interactive, as well as a way to store and save contacts to files to preserve the data across runs.

I have also included in depth unit tests to ensure the validity and robustness of each method.
